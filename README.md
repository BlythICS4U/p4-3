# p4-3 Swing Layouts

The NetBeans projects in this practice set cover a few examples of Swing layout managers. Have a look at each of the projects and spend some time playing around with the code.

We already covered creating a basic calculator using the NetBeans Swing editor.  As an additional example, have a look at the tutorial [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/learn/index.html).
